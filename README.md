# Polygon and Polygons Python Library

## Overview

This Python library provides classes for working with regular polygons and collections of polygons. The `Polygon` class allows you to create regular polygons with a given number of vertices and circumradius, and it computes various geometric properties such as side length, apothem, area, and perimeter. The `Polygons` class manages a collection of polygons ranging from triangles to polygons with up to `m` vertices and provides utilities to work with them, including an iterator and a method to find the most efficient polygon based on area-to-perimeter ratio.

## Features

- **Polygon Class**: Create and analyze regular polygons.
  - Compute side length, apothem, area, and perimeter.
  - Compare polygons based on vertices and circumradius.

- **Polygons Class**: Manage a collection of polygons.
  - Iterate through polygons with different vertex counts.
  - Find the most efficient polygon (highest area-to-perimeter ratio).

- **PolygonsIterator Class**: An iterator for the `Polygons` collection.

## Installation

To use this library, you can either clone the repository or install it via pip if it is published to PyPI.

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/polygon-polygons-library.git
cd polygon-polygons-library
```

### Installing via pip (if published)

```bash
pip install polygon-polygons-library
```

## Usage

### Creating and Using Polygons

```python
from polygon_polygons_library import Polygon, Polygons

# Create a polygon with 5 vertices and circumradius 10
pentagon = Polygon(n=5, R=10)
print(pentagon)  # Output: Polygon(n=5, R=10)

# Access properties
print(f"Vertices: {pentagon.count_vertices}")
print(f"Interior Angle: {pentagon.interior_angle} degrees")
print(f"Side Length: {pentagon.side_length}")
print(f"Apothem: {pentagon.apothem}")
print(f"Area: {pentagon.area}")
print(f"Perimeter: {pentagon.perimeter}")

# Create a collection of polygons with vertices from 3 to 10, and circumradius 10
polygons = Polygons(m=10, R=10)
print(len(polygons))  # Output: 8 (polygons with 3 to 10 vertices)

# Get the maximum efficiency polygon in the collection
max_efficiency = polygons.max_efficiency_polygon
print(max_efficiency)  # Output: Polygon with the highest area-to-perimeter ratio

# Iterate through all polygons in the collection
for poly in polygons:
    print(poly)
```

## Classes

### `Polygon`

Represents a regular polygon with methods and properties to calculate and return geometric details.

**Constructor:**

- `__init__(self, n, R)`: Initialize a `Polygon` with `n` vertices and circumradius `R`.

**Properties:**

- `count_vertices`: Number of vertices.
- `count_edges`: Number of edges (same as vertices).
- `circumradius`: Circumradius.
- `interior_angle`: Interior angle in degrees.
- `side_length`: Length of each side.
- `apothem`: Radius of the inscribed circle.
- `area`: Area of the polygon.
- `perimeter`: Perimeter of the polygon.

**Methods:**

- `__eq__(self, other)`: Equality comparison.
- `__gt__(self, other)`: Greater-than comparison based on vertices.

### `Polygons`

Manages a collection of polygons and provides methods for analysis and iteration.

**Constructor:**

- `__init__(self, m, R)`: Initialize a `Polygons` collection with polygons having between 3 and `m` vertices.

**Properties:**

- `max_efficiency_polygon`: Polygon with the highest area-to-perimeter ratio.

**Methods:**

- `__len__(self)`: Number of polygons.
- `__iter__(self)`: Iterator for the polygons.
- `__getitem__(self, s)`: Access polygon at index `s`.

### `PolygonsIterator`

Iterator for the `Polygons` class.

**Constructor:**

- `__init__(self, polygon_obj)`: Initialize the iterator.

**Methods:**

- `__iter__(self)`: Return the iterator object.
- `__next__(self)`: Return the next polygon; raises `StopIteration` when finished.
