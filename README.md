# Polygon and Polygons Classes

This Python module defines two classes, `Polygon` and `Polygons`, along with an iterator for iterating through a collection of polygons. The `Polygon` class represents a regular polygon with a given number of vertices and circumradius. The `Polygons` class manages a collection of polygons and provides utility methods for working with them.

## Classes

### `Polygon`

Represents a regular polygon with `n` vertices and a circumradius `R`.

#### Methods and Properties

- **`__init__(self, n, R)`**: Initializes a `Polygon` instance with `n` vertices and circumradius `R`.
- **`count_vertices`**: Returns the number of vertices of the polygon.
- **`count_edges`**: Returns the number of edges of the polygon (same as vertices for regular polygons).
- **`circumradius`**: Returns the circumradius of the polygon.
- **`interior_angle`**: Returns the interior angle of the polygon in degrees.
- **`side_length`**: Returns the length of each side of the polygon.
- **`apothem`**: Returns the apothem (radius of the inscribed circle) of the polygon.
- **`area`**: Returns the area of the polygon.
- **`perimeter`**: Returns the perimeter of the polygon.
- **`__eq__(self, other)`**: Compares two `Polygon` objects for equality based on the number of vertices and circumradius.
- **`__gt__(self, other)`**: Compares two `Polygon` objects to check if one has more vertices than the other.

### `Polygons`

Manages a collection of polygons ranging from a triangle to a polygon with `m` vertices, all with the same circumradius `R`.

#### Methods and Properties

- **`__init__(self, m, R)`**: Initializes a `Polygons` instance with polygons having between 3 and `m` vertices and circumradius `R`.
- **`__len__(self)`**: Returns the number of polygons in the collection.
- **`__iter__(self)`**: Returns an iterator for the collection of polygons.
- **`__getitem__(self, s)`**: Returns the polygon at index `s` in the collection.
- **`max_efficiency_polygon`**: Returns the polygon with the highest area-to-perimeter ratio.

### `PolygonsIterator`

An iterator class for iterating through a collection of `Polygon` instances.

#### Methods

- **`__init__(self, polygon_obj)`**: Initializes the iterator with a `Polygons` object.
- **`__iter__(self)`**: Returns the iterator object.
- **`__next__(self)`**: Returns the next polygon in the collection. Raises `StopIteration` when there are no more polygons.

## Installation

You can copy the provided code into a Python file or include it in your Python project. No additional installation is required.

## Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use the classes:

```python
from your_module_name import Polygon, Polygons

# Create a polygon with 5 vertices and circumradius 10
pentagon = Polygon(n=5, R=10)
print(pentagon)  # Output: Polygon(n=5, R=10)

# Create a collection of polygons with vertices from 3 to 10, and circumradius 10
polygons = Polygons(m=10, R=10)
print(len(polygons))  # Output: 8 (polygons with 3 to 10 vertices)

# Get the maximum efficiency polygon in the collection
max_efficiency = polygons.max_efficiency_polygon
print(max_efficiency)  # Output: Polygon with the highest area-to-perimeter ratio

# Iterate through all polygons in the collection
for poly in polygons:
    print(poly)
```

### Summary

- **`Polygon` Class**: Represents individual polygons and calculates various geometric properties.
- **`Polygons` Class**: Manages a collection of polygons and includes methods to find the most efficient polygon based on area-to-perimeter ratio.
- **`PolygonsIterator`**: Allows iteration through the collection of polygons.
